In this chapter, the main theory concepts required to follow the experimental work will be provided.
This includes a first section on dark matter, since the detection of axions (a dark matter candidate) is one interesting application of qubits, as well as the elements of circuit QED required to fully understand the used working principle of a superconducting qubit device.
