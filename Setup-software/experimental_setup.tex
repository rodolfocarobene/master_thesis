\section{Experimental setup}

In this section I will schematically present the experimental setup used for this thesis.
Note however that, being this an experimental work, the setup changed various times and it is difficult to give a complete description of it, for all the states it had.

The schematics presented here correspond to the final setup.

\subsection{Cryostat}

Since the qubits that we are considering are transmons, they work exploiting the superconductivity phenomenon.
To reach the superconductivity regime, we need a device capable of refrigerating it to the mK region.
The device employed for this task is called cryostat.

In this thesis I used both the SD and XLD cryostats manufactured by Bluefors, but the majority of the data presented here was acquired with qubits in the XLD so I will focus on the description of those last setups.

The technique used by cryostats to achieve these temperatures is the dilution refrigeration~\cite{McClintock2003, Craig2004}: a process that exploit a mixture of $^4\mathrm{He}$ and $^3\mathrm{He}$ to reach temperatures below the minimal one achievable through pressure process.
The two isotopes are quite different: the former is a boson with spin $0$ that can be found in natural gas reservoirs, while the latter is a fermion (spin $1/2$) and is the byproduct of tritium fabrication in nuclear reactors.

$\mathrm{^3He}$ can be diluted in $\mathrm{^4He}$ at any concentration, but when the mixture is cooled below $\sim 0.85$ K (note that pure liquid $\mathrm{^3He}$ can be cooled to a minimum of $0.3$ K) it undergoes a spontaneous phase separation.

Two phases now coexist: a concentrated phase composed essentially only of $\mathrm{^3He}$ and a diluted phase that, on the contrary, is mostly composed of $\mathrm{^4He}$.

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \caption{Phase diagram for $\mathrm{He}$ as a function of $\mathrm{^3He}$ concentration.}
    \label{fig:cryostat:heliumphasediagram}
\end{figure}

The graph in \cref{fig:cryostat:heliumphasediagram} shows equilibrium concentrations: intersections of the phase separation line and a horizontal isotherm line correspond to the concentrations of the two different phases (if below the $0.85$ mK threshold).

In the coldest part of the cryostat, the mixing chamber, $\mathrm{^3He}$ atoms cross the interface between the concentrated and the diluted phase.
This transition is endothermic and removes heat from the mixing chamber.
When $\mathrm{^3He}$ dissolves in $\mathrm{^4He}$ at such low temperatures, it undergoes a process similar to evaporation in a vacuum and produces vapor.
The diluted phase is connected to another chamber called still (short for distilling pot) that is held by a heater at $\sim0.7$ K and continuously pumped to remove the vapor which is mainly composed of $\mathrm{^3He}$ because of its greater vapor pressure.
The depletion of $\mathrm{^3He}$ within the still produces an osmotic pressure that drives more $\mathrm{^3He}$ to the still from the mixing chamber where phase transition can continue to happen.
$\mathrm{^3He}$ pumped from the still is reintroduced to the mixing chamber through a flow impedance that enables the helium to condense and that cools it down via heat exchangers that work making use of the cold $\mathrm{^3He}$ that is flowing upwards toward the still. This process is schematized in \cref{fig:cryostat:heliumdilutionrefrigerator}.

In \cref{fig:xldcryostat} some picture of the XLD are present.
Without any thermal load can reach $8$ mK, while with minimal thermal load (the qubits mounted but not probed) is stable at $9$ mK.

\subsection{Qubits Configuration}

At TII, the XLD cryostat was used at its full capacity and contained, at the mixing chamber level:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 3 single non-flux-tunable qubit manufactured by TII, in custom 3D cavities;
    \item a 5 flux-tunable qubits chip, with a star connectivity (namely a single qubit in the middle that can couple to the other four);
    \item a 5 flux-tunable qubits with couplers (namely flux-tunable qubits between other qubits, used to mediate the interaction between the two qubits);
    \item  a 25 qubit chip with 5 readout lines and various qubits connected to each other.
\end{itemize}

In the work for this thesis, I tested and interacted, in particular, with the single qubit devices and one readout line of the 25 qubit chip.

The single qubits, that were changed and replaced over my period at TII, generally share the same schematic and the reader can imagine them as presented in \cref{fig:single_qubit}.

    \label{fig:contraltro_chip}
\end{figure}
The 25 qubits chip is schematically presented in \cref{fig:contraltro_chip}

Among all the present qubits, the \ZCU was connected to line D.\\
Note that every line has 5 qubits plus an isolated one (the yellows) that are qubit used only for testing.\\
Moreover, all the black interconnecting lines are possible two-qubits gates.


\subsection{Configuration and setup for RFSoC4x2}

During this thesis work, the \RFSoC was connected to multiple single qubit in 3D cavities.
Therefore, the setup changed several times, but it always had some stable attributes.
For example, in a single qubit (transmon) non flux tunable, there is only a single line for input (were both readout and drive pulses are fired) and a single readout output (\textit{feedback}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Setup-software/figures/scheme_lines_single.pdf}
    \caption{Schematics of the lines of a single non-flux-tunable qubit in a 3D cavity.}
    \label{fig:lines_single}
\end{figure}

In \cref{fig:lines_single} the two lines (in-fridge) are presented.
All the attenuation present in the IN line is needed to help to reach the single-photon level (or near-single-photon) and its spread to avoid excessive thermal load to a specific stage of the dilution.\\
The filters represented at the mixing chamber level included both IR filter and low-pass filters to clean in the best possible way any noise.

In the readout OUT line, the first element is TWPA~\cite{Yaakobi2013} manufactured by Silent Waves~\cite{silentwaves} continuously pumped (with another line not present in the scheme) during the experiments.
The role of the TWPA is to amplify the signal, inducing a noise amplification quantum limited.
Note that the TWPA was not present in the majority of the setups, but is inserted in the scheme for completeness.\\
At the $4$ K level, a cryogenic HEMT~\cite{Baulieu2022} is present so that the signal, extremely low in the input, becomes measurable.

At room temperature the \textit{feedback signal} is amplified with a LNA (Low Noise Amplifier) manufactured by MiniCircuit~\cite{minicircuit} (max $+8$ dB ) and sent to the \RFSoC ADC 0.\\
The drive source is DAC 0 (B on the board) and sometimes an amplification of max $+8$ dB was needed.
The readout IN was connected to DAC 1 (A on the board) and merged to the drive by using a passive \textit{splitter}.\\
At room temperature, some band-pass filters were added to remove spurious created by the synthesis process and eventual high frequency noise.


\subsection{Configuration and setup for ZCU111}

Similarly as per single qubit control, in \cref{fig:lines_zcu} are showed the in-fridge lines for the control of the multiplexed qubits of the 25 qubits chip. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Setup-software/figures/scheme_lines_25.pdf}
    \caption{Schematics of the lines of a single flux-tunable qubit in the 25 qubit chip.}
    \label{fig:lines_zcu}
\end{figure}

Note first that there are multiple input lines and, in particular, that the readout in and the drive line are are separated.
This is mainly because this is a 2D chip and not a cavity.\\
In any case, both for the readoutIN and the drive the filters are the same already named in the single qubit setup.

For the flux line, on the other hand, the filters are extremely low frequency filters since in theory we just need a DC current.

The TWPA is one of the differing elements. In fact it was not used a standard fixed-band TWPA as per the single qubit setup, but a prototype of a variable-band TWPA~\cite{Ranadive2022}.
This TWPA needs a pump to work and a DC current to tune the amplification band and gain. Both these lines are not showed in the scheme since they are more or less secondary.

Some more differences are present at room temperature, where the setup is a bit more complex.
In particular note that the schematics presented in \cref{fig:lines_zcu} represent a single qubit, but this is a system with 5+1 multiplexed qubits.
Therefore, at room temperature we will have the DAC 6 of the \ZCU connected to the readoutIN while a mux firmware is loaded.
This basically cause the bandwidth to go from $6$ GHz to few MHz, is therefore required a local oscillator with an up-conversion scheme as presented in \cref{fig:up-down-conversion}. 
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Setup-software/figures/upconversion.pdf}
    \caption{Scheme used for down and up-conversion.}
    \label{fig:up-down-conversion}
\end{figure}
As it shown, the same local oscillator is also used for down-conversion.
Since this process uses an IQ mixer, in the down-conversion I and Q are splitted and gets merged back again using a splitter connected to the board ADC 0.

For the drive lines is sometimes needed additional amplification that was provided through a LNA.
They were connected to DAC 3-4-5 to achieve full control of 3 qubits at the same time.

For the flux lines some more work is needed since the outputs of the companion XM500 board (that exposes the SMA connections) have baluns (i.e. DC filters) on its single-ended connection.
There are two option to proceed: it is possible to buy/project a new companion boards or to leverage the 3 differential outputs of the XM500.
This second option was chosen for simplicity.
Note that the differential outputs P-N can be merged together via a simple subtraction P-N, something that standard differential amplifiers easily do, but that since we are aiming for DC currents these are not an option because they use capacitors and operates as high-pass filters.
Special active differential amplifiers are needed in this case.\\
Having bought 3 of them, we were able to bias 3 flux-tunable qubits using DACs 0-1-2.

\subsection{Configuration and setup for ZCU216}

The \textbf{ZCU216} was used with the same setup composed for the \textbf{ZCU111}.
This was a temporary solution that was also limiting the board potential.

In particular, the \textbf{ZCU216} could potentially be used to fully control 7 flux tunable qubits (considering 7 drive lines, 7 flux lines and a maximum of 2 readout inputs), while with the used scheme only three qubits were usable.
To fully unblock the board potential, however, it is needed to make some changes to the \Qick firmware and this requires particular work.
